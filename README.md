# Application of FSM
Automata Theory Project

This is a small game utilizing FSM logic
The FSM is on the Enemy, changing its Sprite and AI, the states are updated based on its mana value and Area2D/RayCast2D collisions

FSM code is on the script ["/finite-state-machine-ex/sprites/redmage/redmage.gd"](https://github.com/soal-ec/FSM_with_Godot/blob/main/finite-state-machine-ex/sprites/redmage/redmage.gd)
